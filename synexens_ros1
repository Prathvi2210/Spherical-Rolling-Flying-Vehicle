This file is for instructions to install the synexens ROS driver in RPi.
First download the .tar.xz file provided by synexens for your product, if using headless without GUI: download it on windows and copy to rpi in the terminal:
>>> scp /path/to/your/file pi@<raspberry_pi_ip>:/home/pi/   

Then extract the archive:
>>> tar -xf synexens_cs20_driver.tar.xz
This will create a folder (likely named something like synexens_ros_driver or similar).

Move it to your ROS workspace
>>> mv synexens_ros_driver ~/catkin_ws/src/
This command is assuming you have a ROS Noetic Workspace

Navigate to the workspace
>>> cd ~/catkin_ws
Install any required dependencies
>>> rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
If rosdep gives any error about missing packages, install them manually using apt

Now compile the workspace (Build the packages)
>>> catkin_make

Source the workspace
>>> source devel/setup.bash
for permanent sourcing add it to your .bashrc
>>> echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

Launch:
>>> roslaunch synexens_ros_driver cs20.launch

After launching, check if data is being published
in another terminal >>> rostopic list 
If you have GUI environment, you can visualize it in RVIZ
>>> rosrun rviz rviz
Add displays (e.g. PointCloud2) in rviz to see the topic data
