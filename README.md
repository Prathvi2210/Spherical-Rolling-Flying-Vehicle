# SRFV-Project
This is a research project for developing a prototype of Spherical Rolling Flying Vehicle.  

First: Synexens Drivers issue with ROS2
Second: RTABmap and TF trees broken in ROS1. Also Synexens CS20 being a new, different sensor, support was minimal and debugging was hard.
Third try to build this project from the start: RPi4 model B, ubuntu 22.04, ROS2 Humble, mavros2-PX4, intel RealSense D455(established sensor instead of Synexens)
